# cosc314-elgamal
The ElGamal Algorithm provides an alternative to the RSA
for public key encryption.
 -Security of the RSA depends on the (presumed)
difficulty of factoring large integers.
 -Security of the ElGamal algorithm depends on the
(presumed) difficulty of computing discrete logs in a
large prime modulus. ElGamal has the disadvantage that the ciphertext is twice as
long as the plaintext. It has the advantage the same plaintext gives a different
ciphertext (with near certainty) each time it is encrypted.
